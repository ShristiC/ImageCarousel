# Welcome to Shristi's Image Carousel

**Author**: Shristi Chitlangia

**Purpose**: Learn to create an Image Carousel Using .NET Maui

**Date:** December 2023

## Installing and Running the App

1. Download the necessary .NET Maui installations

2. If you are working on Mac, Download the necessary Visual Studio for Mac Extensions and Packages

3. Connect a mobile emulator - android or Iphone

4. Run the app!

## Key Features of the App

1. A simple image carousel with a mock title, image, and description that is placed inside of a card. Each image also has an alt text associated with it.

2. Data is pulled in from a csv file of images that contain a URL, title, description, and an alt-text (inspired by the Kaggle Web Harvest Image and Caption dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/web-harvested-image-and-caption-dataset )

3. Swipe and Immerse yourself in the carousel

## Technical Notes

1. Development was done in .NET Maui Native App 

2. C# was used to create the data model, and hold the storage container for the carousel

3. XAML was used for the frontend rendering, styling, and resource files

4. Ultimately, want to keep business logic separate from functionality and behavior

5. Mindful of Accessibility and a possible cross-integration with Cephable's App

## Future Iterations

1. Allow for an upload of an image through phone's photo gallery or by taking a picture through camera - decided that this is not standard to a typical image carousel feature

2. Dark and Light Mode Color Themes

3. Audio Option for Image descriptions to be read aloud

4. Testing with the Cephable App to make the controls gesture, voice, and facial expression accessible

5. Trying the development in Blaze and seeing the difference

## Learnings

1. .NET Maui takes a learning curve, like other cross platform mobilie dev, but has great documentation and examples to quickly pick it up

2. The hardest part is setting up the environment and emulators

3. Working with XAML was an interesting experience, seems to be more statically written than C# or React Native

4. The development was fairly intuitive and was fun!
